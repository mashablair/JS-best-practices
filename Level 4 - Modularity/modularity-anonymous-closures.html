// so far, our module has only public properties
// we hope that no one else ever uses its names

// this namespace has a bunch of public vars and methods which can be accessed by any code that knows the name of the space and its properties

var ARMORY = {
    // should be private
    // b/c it's out data
    weaponList: ['Sword', 'Katana', 'Excaliber', 'Long Sword'],
    armorList: ['shields', 'iron suits', 'shoes', 'gloves'],

    // should be public
    makeWeaponRequest: function() {},
    makeArmorRequest: function() {},

    // should be private
    // b/c it messes with our data
    removeWeapon: function() {},
    replaceWeapon: function() {},
    removeArmor: function() {},
    replaceArmor: function() {}
};

// Here, public methods will signal the private methods to safely modify private data

// each request will make some reference to remove/replace method, which will have access to data lists.  This makes closure very valuable.

// Here is how we gonna do it:
// 1. Wrap the entire set of properties in Anonymous IIFE
// 2. Make desired private properties into local executable code. These local values and methods will eventually be "closed up" into armory's namespaces

// 3. IMPORTANT: To make some properties public, return them as object
// These public properties are in their own object, which will become the ARMORY namespace

var ARMORY1 = (function() {
    // private stuff should be on top
    // should be private, b/c it's out data
    var weaponList = ['Sword', 'Katana', 'Excaliber', 'Long Sword'];
    var armorList = ['shields', 'iron suits', 'shoes', 'gloves'];

    // should be private, b/c it messes with our data
    // These are now belong to the function, instead of directly to the namespace!
    var removeWeapon = function() {};
    var replaceWeapon = function() {};
    var removeArmor = function() {};
    var replaceArmor = function() {};

    // should be public, so we gonna return them in an object
    // Since the function expression is actually called, thir returned object will be handed immediately to the ARMORY variable and become a namespace
    return {
        makeWeaponRequest: function() {},
        makeArmorRequest: function() {},
    };


})();
