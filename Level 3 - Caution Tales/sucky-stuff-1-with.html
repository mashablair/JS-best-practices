<h1>No. 1: JS keyword 'with' is unreliable and often expensive, so it's generally avoided</h1>

<script>

// No. 1:  Don't use 'with'
// 'with' tries and limits redundancy, but makes uncertain scope
// Best practice: Use variables to cache your objects
// caching values 1) avoid lots of typing 2) very clear in indication

var castle = {
    soliders: 8473,
    capacity: 3937772,
    keep: {
        soliders: 19,
        capacity: 40,
        drawbridge: {
            soldiers: 3,
            capacity: 5,
            open: function() {}
        }
    }
};


// with cached clarity (var o), team can understand code's functionality. Also no lengthy object names!
var reinforcement = 12;
var o = castle.keep.drawbridge;
if (o.capacity >= o.soliders + reinforcement) {
    o.open();
    o.soliders += reinforcement;
    console.log("Drawbride soliers: " + o.soliders);
} else {
    console.log("Reinforcement will require split unit.");
}


// No. 2:  eval
// keyword 'eval' might affect legibility, ability to debug and performance

var regiments = [
    {name: "Bill", lastname: "Ford"},
    {name: "Sophie", lastname: "Blair"}
];

function assignRegimentsMotto(number, motto) {
    eval("regiments[" + number + "]").motto = motto;
}

// eval method takes a string as a parameter and start JS compiler, and treat it as if it were a line of code to execute

// assignRegimentsMotto(1, "The King's Own"); // --> regiment1.moto = 'The King's Own' --> syntax error

assignRegimentsMotto(0, "Hey world!"); // --> Bill's motto is updated!
console.log(regiments[0].motto); // --> 'Hey world!'

// here the result code is invalid b/c of extra apostrophe, which makes the compiler think the string is complete...until it sees more stuff ---> marks code as invalid JS

// Best practice:  Just use arrays for mapping numbers to objects:


function assignRegimentsMotto2(number, motto) {
    regiments[number].motto = motto;
}

// above we just use the associative nature of arrays to build any dynamic mapping.  Referencing array is much fatser than parsing and running a new mini-program

assignRegimentsMotto2(1, "We are the best!"); // --> Sophie's motto is updated!
console.log(regiments); // both objects in this array are updated with the new property 'motto'


// But what if I need to read and write stringy JSON data?
// Using 'eval' to parse JSON data is often unsafe, b/c 'eval' evaluates any script

// Best practice here is to use JSON.parse() to ensure only JSON is accepted

var regimentJSON = '{' +
    '"regiment1": { "motto": "The King\'s Own",' + '"numMembers": 46},' +
    '"regiment2": { "motto": "The Best of the Best",' + '"numMembers": 30}' +
'}';

var regiments2 = JSON.parse(regimentJSON);
console.log(regiments2); // --> 2 nice objects





// No. 3:  Leaving off { }
// like this
var isKing = true;
if (isKing)
    weapon = "Excalibur";
else
    weapon = "Sword";

// adding more statements nore statements to this code above will prodice error!



// EXERCISES
// instead of using 'with':
// Pack of goods
var pack = {
  foodPouch: ['carrot', 'mystery meat', 'apple', 42],

  // Place in pack to keep your fire starting goods
  fireKit: {
    matchTin: {
      matches: 4,
      sparkPaper: 6
    }
  }
};

var matches = 3;
function lightCampFire() {
    var tin = pack.fireKit.matchTin;
    tin.matches--;
    tin.sparkPaper--;
}
